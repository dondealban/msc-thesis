	abstract = {Information on the distribution of tropical forests is critical to decision-making on a host of globally significant issues ranging from climate stabilization and biodiversity conservation to poverty reduction and human health. The majority of tropical nations need high-resolution, satellite-based maps of their forests as the international community now works to craft an incentive-based mechanism to compensate tropical nations for maintaining their forests intact. The effectiveness of such a mechanism will depend in large part on the capacity of current and near-future Earth observation satellites to provide information that meets the requirements of international monitoring protocols now being discussed. Here we assess the ability of a state-of-the-art satellite radar sensor, the ALOS/PALSAR, to support large-area land cover classification as well as high-resolution baseline mapping of tropical forest cover. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis involving twenty separate PALSAR- and Landsat-based classifications, we confirm the potential of PALSAR as an accurate (90\%) source for spatially explicit estimates of forest cover based on data and analyses from a large and diverse region encompassing the Xingu River headwaters in southeastern Amazonia. Pair-wise spatial comparisons among maps derived from PALSAR, Landsat, and PRODES, the Brazilian Amazon deforestation monitoring program, revealed a high degree of spatial similarity. Given that a long-term data record consisting of current and future spaceborne radar sensors is now expected, our results point to the important role that space-borne imaging radar can play in complementing optical remote sensing to enable the design of robust forest monitoring systems.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to study the use of a decision tree classifier and multiscale texture measures to extract thematic information on the tropical vegetation cover from the Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) JERS-1 SAR mosaics. We focus our study on a coastal region of Gabon, which has a variety of land cover types common to most tropical regions. A decision tree classifier does not assume a particular probability density distribution of the input data, and is thus well adapted for SAR image classification. A total of seven features, including wavelet-based multiscale texture measures (at scales of 200, 400, and 800 m) and multiscale multitemporal amplitude data (two dates at scales 100 and 400 m), are used to discriminate the land cover classes of interest. Among these layers, the best features for separating classes are found by constructing exploratory decision trees from various feature combinations. The decision tree structure stability is then investigated by interchanging the role of the training samples for decision tree growth and testing. We show that the construction of exploratory decision trees can improve the classification results. The analysis also proves that the radar backscatter amplitude is important for separating basic land cover categories such as savannas, forests, and flooded vegetation. Texture is found to be useful for refining flooded vegetation classes. Temporal information from SAR images of two different dates is explicitly used in the decision tree structure to identify swamps and temporarily flooded vegetation.},

	abstract = {Summary: Pvclust is an add-on package for a statistical software R to assess the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis. Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.

	abstract = {Conversion of tropical forests to oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia has resulted in large-scale environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity and significant carbon emissions. For both countries to participate in the United Nation’s REDD (Reduced Emission from Deforestation and Degradation) mechanism, assessment of forest carbon stocks, including the estimated loss in carbon from conversion to plantation, is needed. In this study, we use a combination of field and remote sensing data to quantify both the magnitude and the geographical distribution of carbon stock in forests and timber plantations, in Sabah, Malaysia, which has been the site of significant expansion of oil palm cultivation over the last two decades. Forest structure data from 129 ha of research and inventory plots were used at different spatial scales to discriminate forest biomass across degradation levels. Field data was integrated with ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land-Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery to both discriminate oil palm plantation from forest stands, with an accuracy of 97.0\% (j = 0.64) and predict AGB using regression analysis of HV-polarized PALSAR data (R2 = 0.63, p {\textless} .001). Direct estimation of AGB from simple regression models was sensitive to both environmental conditions and forest structure. Precipitation effect on the backscatter data changed the HV prediction of AGB significantly (R2 = 0.21, p {\textless} .001), and scattering from large leaves of mature palm trees significantly impeded the use of a single HV-based model for predicting AGB in palm oil plantations. Multi-temporal SAR data and algorithms based on forest types are suggested to improve the ability of a sensor similar to ALOS PALSAR for accurately mapping and monitoring forest biomass, now that the ALOS PALSAR sensor is no longer operational.},

	abstract = {The intent of this paper is to explore the application of information obtained from fully polarimetric data for land cover classification. Various land cover classification techniques are available in the literature, but still uncertainty exists in labeling various clusters to its own class without using any a priori information. Therefore, the present work is focused on analyzing useful intrinsic information extracted from SAR observables obtained by various decomposition techniques. The eigenvalue decomposition and Pauli decomposition have been carried out to separate classes on the basis of their scattering mechanisms. The various supervised classification techniques were applied in order to see possible differences among SAR observables in terms of information that they contain and their usefulness in classifying particular land cover type. Another important issue is labeling the clusters, and this work is carried out by decision tree classification that uses knowledge based approach. This classifier is implemented by scrupulous knowledge of data obtained by empirical evidence and their experimental validation. It has been demonstrated quantitatively that standard polarimetric parameters such as polarized backscatter coefficients (linear, circular and linear 45°), co and cross-pol ratios for both linear and circular polarizations can be used as information bearing features for making decision boundaries. This forms the basis of discrimination between various classes in sequential format. The classification approach has been evaluated for fully polarimetric ALOS PALSAR L-band level 1.1 data. The classifier uses these data to classify individual pixel into one of the five categories: water, tall vegetation, short vegetation, urban and bare soil surface. The quantitative results shown by this classifier gives classification accuracy of about 88\%, which is better than other classification techniques (supervised classification techniques based on SAR observables).},

	abstract = {Four global mosaics of Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) HH and HV polarization data were generated at 25 m spatial resolution using data acquired annually from 2007 to 2010. Variability in L-band HH and HV gamma-naught (γ0) for forests was observed between regions, with this attributed to differences in forest structure and vegetation/surface moisture conditions. Region-specific backscatter thresholds were therefore applied to produce from each annual mosaic, a global map of forest and non-forest cover from which maps of forest losses and gain were generated. The overall agreement with forest/non-forest assessments using the Degree Confluence Project, the Forest Resource Assessment and Google Earth images was 85\%, 91\% and 95\% respectively. Using 2007 as a baseline, decreases of 0.040 and 0.028 dB (with a 0.006 dB 99\% confidence level) were observed in the HH and HV γ0 respectively over the same areas suggesting a decrease in forest area and/or increased smoothing of the global surface at the L-band radar observation over the four-year period. The maps provide a new global resource for documenting the changing extent of forests and offer opportunities for quantifying historical and future dynamics through comparison with historical (1992–1998) Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) SAR and the forthcoming (from 2014) ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data.

Seasat SAR imagery of Oklahoma was used to evaluate the textural autocorrelation function of five land-use categories: water, forest, pasture, urban, and cultivated. It was found that the maximum classification accuracy achievable using first-order statistics was 72 percent and that this level of accuracy was obtainable only by significantly degrading the spatial resolution in order to increase the number of independent samples per pixel. In contrast, second-order statistics-specifically, image contrast and inverse moment-provided a classification accuracy of 88 percent, with only a modest degradation in spatial resolution. A second study using SIR-A imagery of five forested regions has shown that the use of textural information can improve the classification accuracy among the five forest types from 75 to 93 percent.},

The classifier was implemented using the Japanese Earth Remote Sensing Satellite (JERS-1) 100 m resolution radar data acquired over the Amazon Rainforest as part of the Global Rainforest Mapping (GRFM) Project. Demonstrated here is the use of the information content present in different texture measurements at different scales to separate three categories of land cover types: forest from nonforest, terre firme from floodplain vegetation, and grassland from woodland savanna. Various combinations of first-order image statistics known as texture measures were used at different scales as feature dimensions to aid the class discrimination. Eight of the most common first-order texture measures found in the literature were used. The best combination of texture measures at each scale were determined by employing a class separability test using the Bhattachuryya distance. The results were then used as input images into a supervised multiscale maximum likelihood estimation classifier. The classified maps were validated against independent test sites, and by comparison with a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) classification. It was found that JERS-1 backscatter and texture measures can discriminate forest from nonforest types with very high accuracy (above 90\%). Old secondary forest or regrowth areas were often mixed with forest. Radar backscatter alone was able to separate terre firme and floodplain vegetation. However, texture measures were important in separating open from dense floodplain vegetation. Similarly, the backscatter sensitivity to low biomass values was instrumental in separating woodland from grassland savanna. Texture had a lesser role in separating these two vegetation types but was important to separate the woodland savanna from dense evergreen forest and secondary forests.},

This study used the Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering model (MIMICS) and forest canopy biometric data from tropical and subtropical broadleaf forests to simulate a series of forest stands having equivalent above ground biomass while still exhibiting substantial structural differences. The model stands were made to represent a guide range of basic structural differences found in Earth's broadleaf forests. The radar response to these structural differences is shown for the NASA/JPL AIRSAR P-, L.-, and C-band quadpol. configuration at incidence angles of 20 deg;, 40 deg;, and 60 deg;. Results for three sets of equal-biomass-forest-stands were generated: five structural types having a total above ground biomass of 5 kg/m2, three structural types at 15 kg/m2, and three structural types at 30 kg/m2. Simplified model input were used to reduce the number of geometric variables tested across the range of structural types. The potential effect that extreme structural differences might have on the biomass signal and saturation threshold was assessed. Results indicate that structure can have a considerable effect on the SAR return for forests with equivalent above ground biomass. Differences in backscatter of up to 18 dB were predicted for some bands and polarizations. A forest canopy structural descriptor derived from the vegetation surface area to volume ratio (SA/V), which is a measure of structural consolidation, appears to explain the differences in backscatter. In many vegetation stands structural consolidation is directly related to an increase in biomass during the ldquo;thinning phase rdquo; of forest succession. This structural effect may explain the good relationship between SAR backscatter and biomass in these cases},

For both the additive and multiplicative cases, the a priori mean and variance of each pixel is derived from its local mean and variance. Then, the minimum mean-square error estimator in its simplest form is applied to obtain the noise filtering algorithms. For multiplicative noise a statistical optimal linear approximation is made. Experimental results show that such an assumption yields a very effective filtering algorithm. Examples on images containing 256 x 256 pixels are given.

	abstract = {Boreal ecosystems play an essential role in global climate regulation. Forests constitute pools of terrestrial carbon and are generally considered as global sinks of atmospheric CO2, contributing to attenuating the greenhouse effect. Large amounts of carbon are also stored in boreal lakes, bogs and wetlands, partially released as CH4 and other trace gases to the atmosphere during the spring and summer months. Human activities in the forest zone are however reducing the size of the carbon pool and climate change is triggering shorter winters and earlier thaw onset, changing the natural equilibrium. Given its global importance, there is a need to map and monitor the boreal zone, and as the changes occur on all from local, regional to global scales, fine resolution information over vast areas is required. The Global Boreal Forest Mapping (GBFM) project is an international collaborative undertaking initiated by NASDA in 1996, as a follow-on to the tropical-focused Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) project [A. Rosenqvist et al., (2000)]. Utilising the L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1). one of the main objectives of the GBFM project is the generation of extensive, pan-boreaL SAR image mosaics, to provide snap-shots of the forest wetland and open water status in the mid-1990's. Mosaics over Canada, Alaska. Siberia and Europe have been generated, available on the Internet and on DVD free of charge for research and educational purposes. The GBFM project also entails research activities in North America, Siberia and northern Europe, aimed at advancing scientific applications of L-band SAR data in the boreal zone.},

	abstract = {This paper on reports the production of a 1 km spatial resolution land cover classification using data for 1992-1993 from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). This map will be included as an at-launch product of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to serve as an input for several algorithms requiring knowledge of land cover type. The methodology was derived from a similar effort to create a product at 8 km spatial resolution, where high resolution data sets were interpreted in order to derive a coarse-resolution training data set. A set of 37 294 x 1 km pixels was used within a hierarchical tree structure to classify the AVHRR data into 12 classes. The approach taken involved a hierarchy of pair-wise class trees where a logic based on vegetation form was applied until all classes were depicted. Multitemporal AVHRR metrics were used to predict class memberships. Minimum annual red reflectance, peak annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and minimum channel three brightness temperature were among the most used metrics. Depictions of forests and woodlands, and areas of mechanized agriculture are in general agreement with other sources of information, while classes such as low biomass agriculture and high-latitude broadleaf forest are not. Comparisons of the final product with regional digital land cover maps derived from high-resolution remotely sensed data reveal general agreement, except for apparently poor depictions of temperate pastures within areas of agriculture. Distinguishing between forest and non-forest was achieved with agreements ranging from 81 to 92\% for these regional subsets. The agreements for all classes varied from an average of 65\% when viewing all pixels to an average of 82\% when viewing only those 1 km pixels consisting of greater than 90\% one class within the high-resolution data sets.},

The analysis of multitemporal SAR images, supported by several Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and field knowledge, showed that wood materials left following the deforestation practices function as corner reflectors, causing an initial increase in the radar backscatter, which then subsequently decreases over time as the debris on these fields are removed.},

	abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most promising remote sensors to map forest carbon. The unique spaceborne and long-wavelength SAR data currently available are L-band data, but their relationship with forest biomass is still controversial, particularly for high biomass values. While many studies assume a complete loss of sensitivity above a saturation point, typically around 100 t.ha− 1, others assume a continuous positive correlation between SAR backscatter and biomass. The objective of this paper is to revisit the relationship between L-band SAR backscatter and dense tropical forest biomass for a large range of biomass values using both theoretical and experimental approaches. Both approaches revealed that after reaching a maximum value, SAR backscatter correlates negatively with forest biomass. This phenomenon is interpreted as a signal attenuation from the forest canopy as the canopy becomes denser with increasing biomass. This result has strong implications for L-band vegetation mapping because it can lead to a greater-than-expected under-estimation of biomass. The consequences for L-band biomass mapping are illustrated, and solutions are proposed.},

The Advanced Land-Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were acquired during a six month interval. A clear-sky Landsat-5/TM image acquired at the same period was used as additional ground reference and as ancillary input data in the classification scheme. We evaluated backscattering intensity, polarimetric features, interferometric coherence and texture parameters for classification purposes using support vector machines (SVM) and feature selection. Results showed that the forest classes were characterized by low temporal backscattering intensity variability, low coherence and high entropy. Quad polarization mode performed better than dual and single polarizations but overall accuracies remain low and were affected by precipitation events on the date and prior SAR date acquisition. Misclassifications were reduced by integrating Landsat data and an overall accuracy of 85\% was attained. The integration of Landsat to both quad and dual polarization modes showed similarity at the 5\% significance level. SVM was not affected by SAR dimensionality and feature selection technique reveals that co-polarized channels as well as SAR derived parameters such as Alpha-Entropy decomposition were important ranked features after Landsat’ near-infrared and green bands. We show that in absence of Landsat data, polarimetric features extracted from quad-polarization L-band increase classification accuracies when compared to single and dual polarization alone. We argue that the joint analysis of SAR and their derived parameters with optical data performs even better and thus encourage the further development of joint techniques under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism.},

The spatial distribution of these habitats influence the abundance and interactions of animal species, and the change or destruction of habitat can cause the disturbance of key biological processes. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT-2, and ENVISAT/ASAR data to map ecosystems and create a lake distribution map of the Lower Nhecolândia subregion in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, backscattering analysis was conducted on individual training objects to gain a better understanding of the backscattering characteristics of each class. Then, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification based on hierarchical principles first classified the region into “Lakes” and “Not Lakes”. This was followed by a Level 2 classification defining six vegetation habitats (Forest Woodland, Open Wood Savanna, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland and Vazantes) which was achieved at an overall accuracy of 83\%. A Level 3 classification defined the “Lakes” class into a) Fresh (baías) and Brackish (salinas) lakes (accuracy results of 98\%); and a further classification level dividing the fresh lakes, b) Fresh Lakes with floating and emergent vegetation (baías), and Fresh Lakes with the presence of Typha (salobras), and including the Brackish lakes (salinas) (overall accuracy results of 81\%). The results of this study provide the first fine spatial resolution classification showing the spatial distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the entire subregion of Lower Nhecolândia using dual season, dual polarization C and L-band SAR imagery. The produced maps will provide valuable habitat information to help define conservation strategies and aid further research in the area.},

	abstract = {Southeast Asia experienced higher rates of deforestation than other continents in the 1990s and still was a hotspot of forest change in the 2000s. Biodiversity conservation planning and accurate estimation of forest carbon fluxes and pools need more accurate information about forest area, spatial distribution and fragmentation. However, the recent forest maps of Southeast Asia were generated from optical images at spatial resolutions of several hundreds of meters, and they do not capture well the exceptionally complex and dynamic environments in Southeast Asia. The forest area estimates from those maps vary substantially, ranging from 1.73×106 km2 (GlobCover) to 2.69×106 km2 (MCD12Q1) in 2009; and their uncertainty is constrained by frequent cloud cover and coarse spatial resolution. Recently, cloud-free imagery from the Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) became available. We used the PALSAR 50-m orthorectified mosaic imagery in 2009 to generate a forest cover map of Southeast Asia at 50-m spatial resolution. The validation, using ground-reference data collected from the Geo-Referenced Field Photo Library and high-resolution images in Google Earth, showed that our forest map has a reasonably high accuracy (producer's accuracy 86\% and user's accuracy 93\%). The PALSAR-based forest area estimates in 2009 are significantly correlated with those from GlobCover and MCD12Q1 at national and subnational scales but differ in some regions at the pixel scale due to different spatial resolutions, forest definitions, and algorithms. The resultant 50-m forest map was used to quantify forest fragmentation and it revealed substantial details of forest fragmentation. This new 50-m map of tropical forests could serve as a baseline map for forest resource inventory, deforestation monitoring, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) implementation, and biodiversity.},

The relationships were highly significant, similar among sites, and displayed high prediction accuracies up to 150 Mg ha 1 ( 20\%). AGB predictions for any given site obtained using equations derived from data from only the other three sites generated only small increases in error. The results suggest that a widely applicable general relationship exists between AGB and L-band backscatter for lower-biomass tropical woody vegetation. This relationship allows regional-scale AGB estimation, required for example by planned REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) schemes.},

	abstract = {An approach has been developed that involves the fit of a combination of three simple scattering mechanisms to polarimetric SAR observations. The mechanisms are canopy scatter from a cloud of randomly oriented dipoles, even- or double-bounce scatter from a pair of orthogonal surfaces with different dielectric constants and Bragg scatter from a moderately rough surface. This composite scattering model is used to describe the polarimetric backscatter from naturally occurring scatterers. The model is shown to describe the behavior of polarimetric backscatter from tropical rain forests quite well by applying it to data from NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL’s) airborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) system. The model fit allows clear discrimination between flooded and nonflooded forest and between forested and deforested areas, for example. The model is also shown to be usable as a predictive tool to estimate the effects of forest inundation and disturbance on the fully polarimetric radar signature. An advantage of this model fit approach is that the scattering contributions from the three basic scattering mechanisms can be estimated for clusters of pixels in polarimetric SAR images. Furthermore, it is shown that the contributions of the three scattering mechanisms to the HH, HV, and VV backscatter can be calculated from the model fit. Finally, this model fit approach is justified as a simplification of more complicated scattering models, which require many inputs to solve the forward scattering problem.},

Then, a combination of additional refined thresholds, hierarchical rules, and a supervised nearest neighbor algorithm (eCognition Feature Space Optimization) employing several features as primary inputs (mean, standard deviation, seasonal change detection, brightness, maximum difference, area, roundness, brightness, compactness, shape index, and length/width) was utilized, resulting in the definition and classification of ten habitat classes: Forest/Woodland, Riparian Forest, Open Wood Savanna, Open Wood Savanna subject to prolonged flooding, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland, Swampy Mixed Savanna, Vazantes, and Water. This classification was achieved with an overall accuracy of 80\% for the entire Pantanal.

	abstract = {This paper describes the operational radar mapping processing chain developed and steps taken to produce a provisional wide-area PALSAR forest and land cover map covering Borneo for the year 2007, compliant with emerging international standards (CEOS guidelines, FAO LCCS). A Bayesian approach based on (unsupervised) mixture modeling followed by Markov Random Field (MRF) classification has been selected for its suitability and flexibility to deal with a situation where ground truth is sparse and sometimes ambiguous. The methodology is based on the classification of Fine Beam Single (FBS) and Fine Beam Dual (FBD) polarization (path) image pairs. To cover Borneo the equivalent of 554 standard images is required. Qualitative and quantitative validation results and findings are reported. The final overall accuracy assessment result shows the demonstration map product is in 85.5\% full agreement with the independent reference dataset and in 7.8\% 'partial agreement'. The accuracy achieved is widely considered adequate, a very promising result for a sub-continental high resolution map based on just single-year radar data. Approaches for further improvement of the accuracy of less accurately classified thematic classes such as grassland, cropland and shrubland are suggested. This work has been undertaken in part within the framework of the ALOS Kyoto \& Carbon Initiative.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests in countries like the Philippines are important sources and sinks of carbon(C). The paper analyzes the contribution of Philippine forests in climate change mitigation. Since the 1500s, deforestation of 20.9 M ha (106 ha) of Philippine forests contributed 3.7 Pg (1015 g) of C to the atmosphere of which 2.6 Pg were released this century. At present, forest land uses store 1091 Tg(1012 g) of C and sequester 30.5 Tg C/yr while releasing 11.4 Tg C/yr through deforestation and harvesting. In the year 2015, it is expected that the total C storage will decline by 8\% (1005 Tg) and total rate of C sequestration will increase by 17\% (35.5 Tg/yr). This trend is due to the decline in natural forest area accompanied by an increase in tree plantation area. We have shown that uncertainty in national C estimates still exists because they are readily affected by the source of biomass and C density data. Philippine forests can act as C sink by: conserving existing C sinks, expanding C stocks, and substituting wood products for fossil fuels. Here we analyze the possible implications of the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol to Philippine forests. Finally, we present current research and development efforts on tropical forests and climate change in the Philippines to improve assessments of their role in the nations C budgets.},

For seven test sites from various ecoregions in North and South America, ERS-1/JERS-1 composites were generated using high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data for terrain correction of geometric and radiometric distortions. An edge-preserving speckle reduction process was applied to reduce the fading variance and prepare the data for an unsupervised clustering of the two-dimensional (2D) SAR feature space. Signature-based classification of the clusters was performed for all test sites with the same set of radar backscatter signatures, which were measured from well-defined polygons throughout all test sites. While trained on one-half of the polygons, the classification result was tested against the other half of the total sample population. The multisite study was followed by a multitemporal study in one test site, clearly showing the necessity of including multitemporal data beyond a level 1 (woody, herbaceous, mixed) vegetation characterization. Finally, classifications with simulation of backscatter variations shows the dependence of the classification results on calibration accuracy and on naturally occurring backscatter changes of natural surfaces. Overall, it is demonstrated that the combination of existing orbital L- and C-band SAR data is quite powerful for structural vegetation characterization},

LCCS is a comprehensive, standardized a priori classification system designed to meet specific user requirements, and created for mapping exercises, independent of the scale or means used to map. It enables a comparison of land cover classes regardless of data source, thematic discipline or country. The LCCS system enhances the standardization process and minimizes the problem of dealing with a very large amount of pre-defined classes. To facilitate the complex classification process and ensure standardization, innovative software has been developed to guide the user to select the appropriate class. The following manual accompanies version 2 of the LCCS software, which has been developed on the experience gained from numerous FAO/UNEP and country mapping activities including the Africover East Africa Project. The new version of the LCCS software is fully compatible with the previous version to ensure continuity of past and future LCCS mapping activities.},

	abstract = {Natural complexity can best be explored using spatial analysis tools based on concepts of landscape as process continuums that can be partially decomposed into objects or patches. We introduce a five-step methodology based on multi-scale segmentation and object relationship modelling. Hierarchical patch dynamics (HPD) is adopted as the theoretical framework to address issues of heterogeneity, scale, connectivity and quasi-equilibriums in landscapes. Remote sensing has emerged as the most useful data source for characterizing land use/land cover but a vast majority of applications rely on basic image processing concepts developed in the 1970s: one spatial scale, per-pixel classification of a multi-scale spectral feature space. We argue that this methodology does not make sufficient use of spatial concepts of neighbourhood, proximity or homogeneity. In contrast, the authors demonstrate in this article the utility of the HPD framework as a theoretical basis for landscape analysis in two different projects using alternative image processing methodologies, which try to overcome the ‘pixel-centred’ view. The first project focuses on habitat mapping using a high dimension multi-scale GIS database. Focal patches are derived through aggregating automatically generated landscape segments using sub-patch information including dominant tree crown densities and species. The second project uses fractal-based segmentation to produce multiple candidate segmented agricultural scenes, and then develops a decision framework to choose the combination of segmentation levels best suited to identifying shrub encroachment. The challenge and flexibility of the multi-scale segmentation/object relationship modelling approach lies in the defining of the semantic rules which relate the lower level landscape units or holons to higher levels of organization. We seek to embrace the challenges of scale and hierarchy in landscapes and have tested two different ways to decompose complex natural environments into focal units utilising topological relations to model between the smallest units of differentiation and the focal level. We believe the use of a HPD theoretical framework will help development of better tools for characterizing the patterns and processes, acting through a range of scales, which make up landscapes.},

Results showed that the new deforested areas are not unequivocally detected in either of the single bands individually. Although most of the recent deforestation appears brighter than mature forests in the HH band, the identification of new deforestation using only this band depends on the stage of the clearing process. Then, the contribution of the HV band through a normalized difference index (NDI) is important for detection of the new deforested fronts. Results indicate that the method can be used as the basis for an operational programme to monitor deforestation in the Brazilian Amazônia.},

Owing to persistent clouds and other atmospheric effects in the region, forest managers are facing difficulties in mapping and monitoring the forest cover changes consistently. This article presents an automated mapping method and examines the potentials of ALOS PALSAR data for characterizing natural forest cover in the tropics. Several scenes of high-resolution PALSAR data with HH and HV polarizations were processed to cover Sumatra Island. The mapping method applied image segmentation and threshold techniques to discriminate land covers. Non-forest land covers were separated using HH backscatter thresholds, while forest cover was based on HV thresholds. Twenty-two thematic maps derived at different HV backscatter thresholds were evaluated by comparing the land cover classes of the reference data. Sampling theory was used to determine the required sample size and geographic locations of the reference data. Among the resulting maps, a map with a threshold of − 11.5 dB HV backscatter was found to be more sensitive for portraying the spatial patterns of land covers in the study area. The overall mapping accuracy at this threshold was 79.34\%. Regardless of the data size, this automated mapping approach yielded decent spatial patterns of land covers and proved to be applicable for high-resolution wall-to-wall mapping and monitoring of natural forest cover in wider tropical areas.},

	abstract = {Land-cover classification of an ERS-1/JERS-1 composite is explored in the context of regional- to global-scale applicability. Each of these orbiting synthetic aperture radars provide somewhat complementary information since data is collected using significantly different frequencies, polarizations, and look angles (ERS-1: C-band, VV polarization, 23 deg;; JERS-1: L-band, HH polarization, 35 deg;). This results in a classification procedure for the composite image (a co-registered pair from the same season) that is superior to that obtained from either of the two sensors alone. A conceptual model is presented to show how simple structural attributes of terrain surfaces and vegetation cover relate to the data from these two sensors. The conceptual model is knowledge based; and it is supported by both theoretical considerations and experimental observations. The knowledge-based, conceptual model is incorporated into a classifier that uses hierarchical decision rules to differentiate land-cover classes. The land-cover classes are defined on the basis of generalized structural properties of widespread applicability. The classifier operates sequentially and produces two levels of classification. At level-2, terrain is structurally differentiated into man-made features (urban), surfaces, short vegetation, and tall vegetation. At level-2, the tall vegetation class is differentiated on the basis of plant architectural properties of the woody stems and foliage. Growth forms of woody stems include excurrent (i.e., pines), decurrent (i.e., oaks), and columnar (i.e., palm) architecture. Two classes of leaves are considered: broadleaf and needle-leaf. The composite classifier yields overall accuracies in excess of 90\% for a test site in northern Michigan located along the southern ecotone of the boreal forest. For the area examined, the SAR-based classification is superior to unsupervised classification of multitemporal AVHRR data supplemented with a priori information on elevation, climate, and ecoregion},

A fully automated algorithm, exploiting the synergy of SAR and optical remote sensing for the calibration of a semi-empirical model (Santoro et al., 2011; Cartus et al., 2011), was adopted to map forest aboveground biomass with L-band HH and HV intensity in the northeastern United States. In the retrieval algorithm, a semi-empirical model is calibrated and inverted for each HH and HV image to estimate biomass at the pixel level. Where possible, biomass estimates for single images in a multi-temporal stack were combined in a weighted manner. A comparison with the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset, NBCD 2000 (Kellndorfer et al., in preparation), at different spatial scales indicated the feasibility of the automated biomass retrieval approach and confirmed previous findings that the retrieval accuracy for HV intensity is consistently better than that for HH intensity and depends on the imaging conditions. The weighted combination of the biomass estimates from each intensity image in a multi-temporal stack significantly improved the retrieval performance. Because of regional differences in the multi-temporal coverage with ALOS PALSAR dual polarization data (1–5 images for 2007/08) and the pronounced dependence of the retrieval for single images on the imaging conditions, the possibility of producing maps with consistent accuracy at high resolution was found to be limited. Accurate biomass estimates were obtained when aggregating the ALOS biomass maps at county scale and comparing the estimates to Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) county statistics (RMSE = 12.9 t/ha, R2 = 0.86).},

	abstract = {This study intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) time series mosaics for automatic detection of tropical deforestation in Riau province, Indonesia. Using six time series PALSAR mosaics, the characteristics of HH and HV gamma nought (γ0) in natural forests and deforested areas from 2007 to 2010 and the accuracy of deforestation detection by using a threshold were investigated. We obtained the following results: (1) Applying a simple thresholding method to time series differences of γ0HV was effective for fully automatic detection of deforestation areas. When we used a fixed threshold, the accuracy ranged from 72\% to 96\% (average of 87\%). (2) γ0HH did not always show systematic changes after deforestation. (3) The temporal variation of γ0 for deforested areas was larger than that for natural forests. These variations in γ0 were correlated with 10-day accumulated precipitation. High accumulated precipitation decreased the γ0 difference between deforested areas and natural forests, causing decreased accuracy of deforestation detection. (4) Integration of the results from two different dates in a given year can reduce the detection error due to time variations and provide highly accurate results (average accuracy of 91\%, minimum of 82\%). The accuracy values quoted except hilly areas, shadow, and lay-over. The proposed method is effective for detection of deforestation larger than 1 ha. The deforestation mapping method proposed in the study can be utilized for assessment of yearly changes in forested areas and is useful for tracking changes in forest cover on large scales.},

These approaches to analysing imagery have antecedents in earlier research on image segmentation and use GIS-like spatial analysis within classification and feature extraction approaches. This article investigates these development and its implications and asks whether or not this is a new paradigm in remote sensing and Geographic Information Science (GIScience). We first discuss several limitations of prevailing per-pixel methods when applied to high resolution images. Then we explore the paradigm concept developed by Kuhn (1962) and discuss whether GEOBIA can be regarded as a paradigm according to this definition. We crystallize core concepts of GEOBIA, including the role of objects, of ontologies and the multiplicity of scales and we discuss how these conceptual developments support important methods in remote sensing such as change detection and accuracy assessment. The ramifications of the different theoretical foundations between the ‘per-pixel paradigm’ and GEOBIA are analysed, as are some of the challenges along this path from pixels, to objects, to geo-intelligence. Based on several paradigm indications as defined by Kuhn and based on an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature we conclude that GEOBIA is a new and evolving paradigm.},

It also classifies the scattering by a lighthouse in the ocean and boats on the ocean surface as being similar to that predicted by the even number of reflections class, making it easy to identify these objects against the background of the surrounding ocean. The algorithm is also applied to forested areas and shows that scattering from clear-cut areas and agricultural fields is mostly similar to that predicted by the odd number of reflections class, while the scattering from tree-covered areas generally is classified as being a mixture of pixels exhibiting the characteristics of all three classes, although each pixel is identified with only a single class.},

We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery.

The observations show that the forest types and deforested area are showing variable polarimetric and backscattering properties because of the structural difference. Evergreen forest is characterized by a high value of σ° HV (−12.96 dB) as compared with the deforested area (σ° HV=−22.2 dB). The value of polarimetric parameters such as entropy (0.93), RVI (0.91), PH (0.41) and Freeman–Durden volume scattering (0.43) is high for evergreen forest, whereas deforested area is characterized by the low values of entropy (0.36) and RVI (0.17).

Transformed divergence was used to identify potential textural images which were calculated with the gray-level co-occurrence matrix method. The standard deviation of selected textural images and correlation coefficients between them were then used to determine the best combination of texture images for land-cover classification. Classification results based on different scenarios with maximum likelihood classifier were compared. Based on the identified best scenarios, different classification algorithms – maximum likelihood classifier, classification tree analysis, Fuzzy ARTMAP (a neural-network method), k-nearest neighbor, object-based classification, and support vector machine were compared for examining which algorithm was suitable for land-cover classification in the tropical moist region. This research indicates that the combination of radiometric images and their textures provided considerably better classification accuracies than individual datasets. The L-band data provided much better land-cover classification than C-band data but neither L-band nor C-band was suitable for fine land-cover classification system, no matter which classification algorithm was used. L-band data provided reasonably good classification accuracies for coarse land-cover classification system such as forest, succession, agropasture, water, wetland, and urban with an overall classification accuracy of 72.2\%, but C-band data provided only 54.7\%. Compared to the maximum likelihood classifier, both classification tree analysis and Fuzzy ARTMAP provided better performances, object-based classification and support vector machine had similar performances, and k-nearest neighbor performed poorly. More research should address the use of multitemporal radar data and the integration of radar and optical sensor data for improving land-cover classification.},

The GRFM project relies on extensive collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC) and the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) for data acquisition, processing, validation and product generation. A science programme is underway in parallel with product generation. This involves the agencies mentioned above, as well as a large number of international organizations, universities and individuals to perform field activities and data analysis at different levels. The GRFM project was initiated in 1995 and, through a dedicated data acquisition policy by NASDA, data acquisitions could be completed within a 1.5-year period, resulting in a spatially and temporally homogeneous coverage to encompass the entire Amazon Basin from the Atlantic to the Pacific; Central America up to the Yucatan Peninsular in Mexico; equatorial Africa from Madagascar and Kenya in the east to Sierra Leone in the west; and south-east Asia, including Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. Over the Amazon and Congo river basins, the project aimed to provide complete cover at two different seasons, featuring the basins at high and low water. In total, the GRFM acquisitions comprise some 13000 SAR scenes, which are currently in the course of being processed and compiled into image mosaics. In March 1999, SAR mosaics over the Amazon Basin (one out of two seasonal coverages) and equatorial Africa (both seasonal coverages) were completed; the data are available on CD-ROM and, at a coarser resolution, via the Internet. Coverage of the second-season Amazon and Central America will be completed during 1999, with the south-east Asian data sets following thereafter. All data are being provided free of charge to the international science community for research and educational purposes.},

	abstract = {From its launch in 2006, the phased array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) onboard the advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) has acquired many dual-polarized (FBD) images with a 70-km swath width, aiming to produce spatially consistent coverage over tropical rainforest. This paper investigates the relevancy of PALSAR orthorectified FBD product at 50-m resolution for regional land cover classification by the support vector machines (SVM). Our test site is the Riau province, Sumatra island, Indonesia, known to hold vast area of natural peatland forest with an extreme biodiversity threatened by industrial deforestation. Since it is demonstrated the radiometric information (HH and HV channels) cannot be solely used to achieve a good classification, the spatial information in these orthorectified data is investigated. A new tool using the recursive feature elimination SVM-based process and the textural Haralick’s parameters is introduced. The real contribution of textures within the land cover classification can be understood. A small set of textural parameters is determined at local scale while being optimal for the land cover discrimination. The SVM-based classifier is carried out across the whole Riau province and its results are compared with a Landsat-based estimation. The agreement is over 70\% with six classes and 86\% for the natural forest map. These results are remarkable since only one PALSAR FBD product is used and this assessment is performed on more than 40 million pixels. The results confirm the high potential of the PALSAR sensor for forest monitoring at regional, if not global scale.},

	abstract = {Mapping and monitoring mangrove ecosystems is a crucial objective for tropical countries, particularly where human disturbance occurs and because of uncertainties associated with sea level and climatic fluctuation. In many tropical regions, such efforts have focused largely on the use of optical data despite low capture rates because of persistent cloud cover. Recognizing the ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for providing cloud-free observations, this study investigated the use of JERS-1 SAR and ALOS PALSAR data, acquired in 1996 and 2008 respectively, for mapping the extent of mangroves along the Brazilian coastline, from east of the Amazon River mouth, Pará State, to the Bay of São José in Maranhão. For each year, an object-orientated classification of major land covers (mangrove, secondary vegetation, gallery and swamp forest, open water, intermittent lakes and bare areas) was performed with the resulting maps then compared to quantify change. Comparison with available ground truth data indicated a general accuracy in the 2008 image classification of all land covers of 96\% (kappa = 90.6\%, tau = 92.6\%). Over the 12 year period, the area of mangrove increased by 718.6 km2 from 6705 m2 to 7423.60 km2, with 1931.0 km² of expansion and 1213 km² of erosion noted; 5493 km² remained unchanged in extent. The general accuracy relating to changes in mangroves was 83.3\% (Kappa 66.1\%; tau 66.7\%). The study confirmed that these mangroves constituted the largest continuous belt globally and were experiencing significant change because of the dynamic coastal environment and the influence of sedimentation from the Amazon River along the shoreline. The study recommends continued observations using combinations of SAR and optical data to establish trends in mangrove distributions and implications for provision of ecosystem services (e.g., fish/invertebrate nurseries, carbon storage and coastal protection).},

	abstract = {This research investigated the ability of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) to map tropical forest in central Sumatra, Indonesia. The study used PALSAR 50 m resolution orthorectified HH and HV data. As land-cover discrimination is difficult with only two bands (HH and HV), we added textures as additional information for classification. We calculated both first- and second-order texture features and studied the effects of texture window size, quantization scale and displacement length on discrimination capability. We found that rescaling to a lower number of grey levels (8 or 16) improved discrimination capability and that equal probability quantization was more effective than uniform quantization. Increasing displacement tended to reduce the discrimination capability. Low spatial resolution increased the discrimination capability because low spatial resolution features reduce the effects of noise. A larger number of features also improved discrimination capability. However, the amount of improvement depended on the window size. We used the optimum combination of backscatter amplitude and textures as input data into a supervised multi-resolution maximum likelihood classification. We found that including texture information improved the overall classification accuracy by 10\%. However, there was significant confusion between natural forest and acacia plantations, as well as between oil palm and clear cuts, presumably because the backscatter and texture of these class pairs are very similar.},

The paper reviews the need for a comprehensive, concise and acceptably cheap way to accomplish the task; and it assesses the types of remote sensing available through satellite surveys, from the early Landsat technologies to the latest equipment. In particular, the paper appraises the more-refined and sophisticated technologies now available, which can often distinguish between different types of forest cover and between different degrees of deforestation (complete or partial).

The dataset analyzed includes Landsat 5 data from circa 1990 (+/- 3 years) and Landsat 7 data from circa 2000. Image dates were determined based on the availability of free, nearly cloud-free imagery from the University of Maryland’s Global Land Cover Facility (http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/index.shtml). Additional scenes were also purchased for areas most heavily covered with clouds. A supervised classification approach was employed, using a decision tree classifier. The total amount of forest cleared during the time period was 20.1 km2 in the Eastern Mindanao corridor and 37.5 km2 in the Palawan biodiversity corridor, representing an average annual forest clearance rate of 0.04 percent for Eastern Mindanao and 0.07 percent for Palawan.	Forest fragmentation was also observed to be more apparent in Palawan due to clearance of smaller forest patches. Forest cover interpretation from the Landsat imagery was validated through a collective aerial system of videography and photography. The combined accuracy of the classified maps was 85.4 percent.},

	abstract = {In automatic image interpretation, the process of extracting different objects that compose an image is one of the primary steps. This process is known as image segmentation and consists of subdividing an image into meaningful regions, also called segments, which will be classified in a later step. Many of the existing segmentation algorithms, however, have high computational cost for large images as the currently high-resolution remote sensing images. The main focus of this paper is to tackle this problem by using parallel processing. The idea is to explore current multi-core architectures available in commercial processors in order to speedup the segmentation process. A multithreading parallel implementation of a region growing algorithm proposed originally by Baatz and Schäpe (2000) is presented that aims at providing better execution times, while delivering a similar outcome produced by the sequential version. The algorithm is able to work with any number of threads, which is defined as an input parameter, so as to take full advantage of the upcoming processors having any number of cores. The current parallel implementation was tested on three different images on a quad-core processor and obtained up to 2.6 of segmentation speedup.},

The authors identify several scattering mechanisms and calculate the corresponding Stokes matrices, which combine to give the total Stokes matrix and resulting polarization signature. It is found that this simple model permits accurate prediction of the polarization of the scattered waves and that additional mechanisms, including the effects of leaves and twigs, are not required for the 25-cm observation of the forests studied.

	abstract = {An accurate global carbon budget requires information on terrestrial carbon sink strength. Regenerating tropical forests are known to be important terrestrial carbon sinks but information on their location, extent and biomass (from which carbon content can be estimated) is incomplete. The use of remotely sensed data in optical wavelengths has been of limited use due to both the weak relationship between optical radiation and forest biomass and near‐constant cloud cover in the tropics. L‐band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter, however, is related positively to biomass (but only up to an asymptote of around 40–90 T ha−1) and can be obtained independently of cloud cover. Both canopy structure and biomass change over time as pioneer species are replaced by early and late regenerating species. These structural changes are related to an increase in (i) tree height, (ii) tree species richness and (iii) canopy thickness and influence the roughness of the canopy surface and consequently SAR image texture. Therefore, we investigated the degree to which textural information could be used to increase the correlation between image tone (backscatter) and biomass. Field data were used to estimate the biomass of 37 regenerating forests plots in Brazilian Amazonia. Texture measures derived from local statistics, the grey level co‐occurrence matrix (GLCM) and the variogram were evaluated using simulated images on the basis of their ability to identify significant differences in image texture independently of image contrast. The selected texture measures were applied to L‐band JERS‐1 (Japanese Earth Resources Satellite) SAR images and the correlation between backscatter and biomass was determined for regenerating tropical forests. A strong correlation was found for the texture measures and biomass. The r a 2 (adjusted coefficient of determination), measuring the correlation between backscatter and biomass, increased from 0.74 to 0.82 with the addition of GLCM‐derived contrast. The addition of image texture (GLCM‐derived contrast) to image tone (backscatter) potentially increases the accuracy with which JERS‐1 SAR data can be used to estimate biomass in tropical forests.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests play a major role in storing large carbon stocks and regulating energy, and water fluxes, but such forest cover is decreasing rapidly in spite of the policy attention on reducing deforestation. High-resolution spatiotemporal maps are unavailable for the forests in majority of the tropical regions in Asia because of the persistent cloud cover and haze cover. Recent advances in radar remote sensing have provided weather-independent data of earth surface, thus offering an opportunity to monitor tropical forest change processes with relatively high spatiotemporal resolutions. In this research, we aim to examine the tropical deforestation process and develop a spatial model to simulate future forest patterns under various scenarios. Riau Province from central Sumatra of Indonesia is selected as the study area; this province has received much attention worldwide because the highest CO2 emission resulting from tropical deforestation has been recorded. Annual time series PALSAR data from 2007 to 2010 were analyzed for forest mapping and detecting land cover changes. A spatial model was calibrated using the Bayesian method. Modeling parameters were customized for the local subregions that allocate deforestation on the basis of their empirical relationships to physical and socioeconomic drivers. The model generated landscape spatial patterns mirrored the possible locations and extent of deforested areas by 2030 and provided time-series crucial information on forest landscape under various scenarios for future landscape management projects. The results suggested that the current deforestation process is in a critical stage where some subregions may face unprecedented stress on primary forest costing rivers and forest ecosystems by the end of 2020. The perspective views of Riau Province generated by the model highlighted the need for forest/environmental planning controls for the conservation of environmentally sensitive areas.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of the world's humid tropical forests, our knowledge concerning their rates of change remains limited. Two recent programmes (FAO 2000 Forest Resources Assessment and TREES II), exploiting the global imaging capabilities of Earth observing satellites, have recently been completed to provide information on the dynamics of tropical forest cover. The results from these independent studies show a high degree of conformity and provide a good understanding of trends at the pan-tropical level.In 1990 there were some 1150 million ha of tropical rain forest with the area of the humid tropics deforested annually estimated at 5.8 million ha (approximately twice the size of Belgium). A further 2.3 million ha of humid forest is apparently degraded annually through fragmentation, logging and/or fires. In the sub-humid and dry tropics, annual deforestation of tropical moist deciduous and tropical dry forests comes to 2.2 and 0.7 million ha, respectively. Southeast Asia is the region where forests are under the highest pressure with an annual change rate of −0.8 to −0.9\%. The annual area deforested in Latin America is large, but the relative rate (−0.4 to −0.5\%) is lower, owing to the vast area covered by the remaining Amazonian forests. The humid forests of Africa are being converted at a similar rate to those of Latin America (−0.4 to −0.5\% per year). During this period, secondary forests have also been established, through re-growth on abandoned land and forest plantations, but with different ecological, biophysical and economic characteristics compared with primary forests. These trends are significant in all regions, but the extent of new forest cover has proven difficult to establish.These results, as well as the lack of more detailed knowledge, clearly demonstrate the need to improve sound scientific evidence to support policy. The two projects provide useful guidance for future monitoring efforts in the context of multilateral environmental agreements and of international aid, trade and development partnerships. Methodologically, the use of high-resolution remote sensing in representative samples has been shown to be cost-effective. Close collaboration between tropical institutions and inter-governmental organizations proved to be a fruitful arrangement in the different projects. To properly assist decision-making, monitoring and assessments should primarily be addressed at the national level, which also corresponds to the ratification level of the multilateral environmental agreements. The Forest Resources Assessment 2000 deforestation statistics from countries are consistent with the satellite-based estimates in Asia and America, but are significantly different in Africa, highlighting the particular need for long-term capacity-building activities in this continent.},

	abstract = {The textural information of a multitemporal set of ERS-1 and JERS-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images was studied with the first- and second-order statistical measures. These measures had a higher information value for the land-cover and forest type classification than the SAR image intensity. The multitemporal approach was beneficial for the application of the textural measures; the textural parameters significantly improved the classification of land-cover and forest types. Based on the SAR image texture, the overall classification accuracy for seven land-cover types was 65\%, while with the SAR image intensity, the classification accuracy was 50\%, respectively. In the forest type classification based on the SAR image texture and intensity, the overall classification accuracy for four forest types was 66\%, while with the intensity, the accuracy was 40\%, respectively. The weather and seasonal conditions had a significant effect on the textural information of SAR images. The best separability of the signatures and the best land-cover and forest type classification accuracy was achieved under summer conditions. The snow cover and arid conditions decreased the textural information of the SAR images},

	abstract = {Indonesia has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, with a significant impact on the planetary carbon balance and loss of biodiversity. It also covers a vast and often inaccessible area frequently obscured by clouds, making accurate, timely monitoring of its forests difficult. Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are unhindered by clouds and can provide clear images whenever there is a satellite pass, hence provide a potentially important tool for monitoring forest changes. Over Sumatra, the JAXA Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR L-band radar provided both ScanSAR HH polarisation with repeat images every 46\&\#xa0;days, thus providing much more frequent clear imagery than other available rapid deforestation monitoring tools, and approximately annual Fine-Beam Dual (FBD) image pairs with HH and HV polarisations. Temporal analysis of ScanSAR images shows that deforestation in the Sumatran province of Riau can be identified by large values of the temporal standard deviation, but high detection rates are associated with high false alarm rates, particularly in swamp forest. There does not appear to be a reliable signature of the onset of forest disturbance in the ScanSAR time-series. Deforestation can also be detected in annual FBD data by combining increases and decreases in both the HH and HV channels, since the four types of change are complementary; these different polarisation responses indicate a variety of physical processes that may be involved in the radar signature of deforestation. Significant improvements in performance are possible by combining FBD and ScanSAR data, giving 72\% detection of deforestation for a false alarm rate (detection of deforestation in undisturbed forest) of 20\%. Error analysis based on (a) likely errors in the Landsat data used to provide a reference for deforestation and (b) differences between the times of acquisition of the Landsat data and the FBD data suggest that the true detection rate for the FBD data is underestimated. All the analysis in the paper uses fully automatic methods, but it is likely that false alarms in the ScanSAR data due to periodic flooding could be reduced by human inspection. The performance figures reported here could also be improved if knowledge about the locations of dry and swamp forest was included in the methodology.},

These maps were then analyzed to determine the rates of deforestation and their relationship with factors such as the distance of forests to roads and forest fragmentation (measured by perimeter-to-area ratio (P/A ratio) of forest patches) for this country. The Philippines lost a total of 9.8 million ha of forests from 1934 to 1988. The presence of major roads was a very important factor affecting deforestation. The closer a forest was to roads, the higher the rate of deforestation. Nearly 78\% of the 2.1 million ha of forests within 1.5 km of roads in 1934 was removed by 1988. By contrast, only 39.5\% of forest was lost between 15.0 and 16.5 km from roads. The density of roads per unit area did not predict deforestation as well as the distance of forest patches to roads. The P/A ratio of forest patches was also useful for assessing their rate of clearing. The larger the P/A ratio of a forest patch, the more likely it was to be cleared. Forests with P/A ratios greater than 65 m ha-1 in 1934 had all disappeared by 1988. Forests with large P/A ratios were also characterized by small area and the presence of adjacent agricultural lands in 1934. They were readily cleared and never reforested.},

	abstract = {The recently available space-borne SAR sensor, PALSAR, is more promising than its predecessor JERS-1 for biomass estimation because of its long wavelength (L-band), and its ability to provide data with different polarizations, varying incidence angles and higher spatial resolutions. This research investigates the potential of two-date dual polarization (HH and HV) SAR imagery for biomass estimation using different kinds of texture processing and different combinations of single and dual polarization ratios. The investigation is conducted in a mountainous, sub-tropical study area where biomass levels are far beyond the previously recognized saturation levels for L-band SAR images, and forest is a mixture of native and non-native species and plantations.

We analyzed two-date SAR data with four steps of image processing, including raw data processing in various combinations, texture measurement parameters of HH and HV polarizations, texture measurement parameters of HH and HV together (both jointly and as a ratio), and a ratio of two-date texture parameters along with a single and two-date ratio. When the processed images were compared with ground data from 50 plots, the performance from raw data processing was low, with adjusted r 2 \&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.22, but after all four processing steps, promising model accuracy (adjusted r 2 \&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.90 and RMSE\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;28.58\&\#xa0;t/ha) and validation accuracy (using the Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation) with adjusted r 2 \&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.88 and RMSE\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;35.69\&\#xa0;t/ha, were achieved from the combination of single- and two-date polarization ratios of texture parameters.

The strong performance achieved indicates that L-band dual-polarization (HH and HV) SAR data from PALSAR has great potential for biomass estimation, far beyond the previously reported L-band saturation point for biomass. This result is attributed to the synergy among texture processing and dual polarization on the one hand, which were able to average out random speckle noise, and the use of ratio instead of absolute quantities, due to its well known ability to reduce forest structural and terrain effects. The additional use of two-date SAR data with these processing techniques was able to add complementary information derived from biomass response in both wet and dry seasons. Thus overall, undesirable image noise and terrain effects were reduced.},

The dynamic range of the radar backscatter intensity from forest was found maximum at P-band and decreases with increasing frequencies. Also, cross-polarized backscatter intensity yields the best sensitivities to variations of forest biomass. L-band data confirmed past results on good correlation with forest parameters. The most striking observation has been the strong correlation of P-band backscatter intensity to forest biomass. In order to develop algorithms to infer forest biomass from spaceborne SARs, the experimental results will be compared with observations on other forest ecosystems and will be interpreted by theoretical modeling.},

This is achieved by a general segmentation algorithm based on homogeneity definitions in combination with local and global optimization techniques. A scale parameter is used to control the average image object size. Different homogeneity criteria for image objects based on spectral and/or spatial information are developed and compared.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

	abstract = {The changes in forest cover in many parts of the world lead to increase the accumulation of atmospheric carbon and thus accelerate the process of global warming. Optical remote sensing has been used to map and quantify deforestation but its application is limited because of the presence of cloud coverage on the images. Recent availability of several space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions has widened the scope of utilizing radar images for monitoring of forest cover change. The objective of this investigation is to examine the capability of SAR data to assess and map deforestation. The study area is located at the tropical forest region of southeastern Bangladesh. Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) data of 1994 and Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR data of 2007 were used in this study. ALOS PALSAR data were orthorectified with Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation model data. Image to image geometric registration was done between the two SAR scenes. Study area was clipped and separated as subsets. SIR-C data (L- and C-bands) was in dual polarization (HH and HV) and PALSAR (L-band) was in quad-polarization (HH, HV, VH, and VV). Five different categories of land covers (forest, upland soil/shrubs, lowland soil, settlements, and water/wetlands) were recognized on both SAR scenes. An additional class representing forest re-growth could be identified only on SIR-C image. Both the images were classified using maximum likelihood algorithms. The classification accuracy was computed from the randomly selected independent validation pixels. The accuracy for forest is more than 83\% except users accuracy computed for PALSAR image. Forest was reduced from 18,000 to 13,800 ha in the region during the study period. The results of this study will be useful for understanding the applicability of SAR to map and quantify forest cover changes in the tropics.},

The best correlation function (i.e. from HV backscatter) was used to estimate and determine the aboveground biomass of the Matang Mangroves. The study found that the estimated AGB in Matang Mangroves ranged between 2.98 and 378.32 ± 33.90 Mg ha− 1 with an average of 99.40 ± 33.90 Mg ha− 1 and a total AGB of about 4.25 million Mg. The HV backscatter started to saturate at an AGB of 100 Mg ha− 1 and the errors associated with the estimation occurred largely when the AGB exceeded 150 Mg ha− 1.

Unfortunately most of the forestry records of both the Spanish and American colonial regimes were lost as a result of mishap and warfare. However, by sifting through hitherto largely untapped archival sources in Manila and Washington as well as a considerable body of contemporary commentaries, it is possible to reconstruct a much more accurate picture of the scale of forest loss and chart the growth of a commercial timber market during the second half of the nineteenth century. Attention is also drawn to a fundamental misconception about the effective size of the colonial state and therefore the unit of analysis used to calculate previous attempts at forest cover and depletion. The exclusion or inclusion of Mindanao, the second largest island in the Philippines, has implications for both the true extent of deforestation under Spanish rule and the subsequent rate of forest felling during the ensuing American period. Finally, the contention is made that the quality of forest cover data collected by manual means in the past is perhaps more accurate than previously acknowledged and requires more serious consideration in conjunction with material obtained by modern instrumentation.},

	abstract = {The principal objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach in classifying mangroves from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, specifically Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS), phased array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR), and single-polarized (HH) and dual-polarized (HH + HV) L-bands. The accuracy of the object parameters was examined to determine the optimal colour and shape ratios for the hierarchical classification. At the first level of classification (mangroves from non-mangroves), the results indicate that it is possible to accurately separate mangrove areas from saltpan and water/shallow zones using both sets of SAR images for the Mabala and Yélitono islands of southern Guinea. The final accuracies, based on the most optimal object parameters, were 91.1\% and 92.3\% for the single- and dual-polarized data, respectively. At the second level of classification, separation among the three mangrove classes identified was most accurate when using the dual-polarized data, at an overall accuracy of only 63.4\%. The three mangrove classes identified included tall red mangrove (Rhizophora racemosa), dwarf red mangrove (R. mangle and R. harisonii), and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans). Using the optimal combination of parameters, the extent to which a filter could be used to improve the accuracy was examined. At this level, it was determined that the dual-polarized data, filtered with a 3 × 3 Lee speckle filter and a segmentation scale of 5, resulted in an overall accuracy of 64.9\%. Consequently, it is recommended that for persistently cloud-covered regions, such as Guinea, ALOS PALSAR data using an OBIA could be useful as a quick method for mapping and monitoring mangroves.},

The interplay between the distribution of vegetation, the hydrology, the climate and the geomorphology nourishes and sustains the large diversity of flora and fauna in this wetland, but it is poorly understood at the scale of the entire Pantanal. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR and C-band RADARSAT-2 data to map ecosystems and create spatial-tem- poral maps of flood dynamics in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, an understanding of the backscattering characteristics of floodable and non-floodable habitats was developed. Second, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification defining Forest, Savanna, Grasslands/Agriculture, Aquatic Vegetation and Open Water cover types was achieved with accuracy results of 81\%. A Level 2 classification separating Flooded from Non-Flooded regions for five temporal periods over one year was also accom- plished, showing the interannual variability among sub-regions in the Pantanal. Cross-sensor, multi-temporal SAR data was found to be useful in mapping both land cover and flood patterns in wetland areas. The generated maps will be a valuable asset for defining habitats required to conserve the Pantanal biodiversity and to mitigate the impacts of human development in the region.},

It is very important to monitor such wetlands to inform management on the status of these fragile ecosystems. This study aims to examine the applicability of TerraSAR-X quadruple polarimetric (quad-pol) synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data for classifying wetland vegetation in the Everglades. We processed  quad-pol data using the Hong \&amp; Wdowinski four-component decomposition, which accounts for double bounce scattering in the cross-polarization signal. The calculated decomposition images consist of four scattering mechanisms (single, co- and cross-pol double, and volume scattering). We applied an object-oriented image analysis approach to classify vegetation types with the decomposition results. We also used a high-resolution multispectral optical RapidEye image to compare statistics and classification results with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. The calculated classification accuracy was higher than 85\%, suggesting that the TerraSAR-X quad-pol SAR signal had a high potential for distinguishing different vegetation types. Scattering components from SAR acquisition were particularly advantageous for classifying mangroves along tidal channels. We conclude that the typical scattering behaviors from model-based decomposition are useful for discriminating among different wetland vegetation types.},

	abstract = {Land cover change assessment is one of the main applications of remote sensed data. A number of pixel based classification algorithms have been developed over the past years for the analysis of remotely sensed data. The most notable include the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), support vector machines (SVMs) and the decision trees (DTs). The DTs in particular offer advantages not provided by other approaches. They are computationally fast and make no statistical assumptions regarding the distribution of data. The challenge to using DTs lies in the determination of the “best” tree structure and the decision boundaries. Recent developments in the field of data mining have however, provided an alternative for overcoming the above shortcomings. In this study, we analysed the potential of DTs as one technique for data mining for the analysis of the 1986 and 2001 Landsat TM and ETM+ datasets, respectively. The results were compared with those obtained using SVMs, and MLC. Overall, acceptable accuracies of over 85\% were obtained in all the cases. In general, the DTs performed better than both MLC and SVMs.},

	abstract = {The large number of components, nonlinear interactions, time delays and feedbacks, and spatial heterogeneity together often make ecological systems overwhelmingly complex. This complexity must be effectively dealt with for understanding and scaling. Hierarchy theory suggests that ecological systems are nearly completely decomposable (or nearly decomposable) systems because of their loose vertical and horizontal coupling in structure and function. Such systems can thus be simplified based on the principle of time-space decomposition. Patch dynamics provide a powerful way of dealing explicitly with spatial heterogeneity, and have emerged as a unifying concept across different fields of earth sciences. The integration between hierarchy theory and patch dynamics has led to the emergence of the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm (HPDP). In this paper, I shall discuss some major elements of ecological complexity, hierarchy theory, and hierarchical patch dynamics, and then present a hierarchical scaling strategy. The strategy consists of three stages, each of which may involve a number of steps and methods: (1) identifying appropriate patch hierarchies, (2) making observations and developing models of patterns and processes around focal levels, and (3) extrapolation across the domains of scale using a hierarchy of models. Identifying and taking advantage of the hierarchical structure and near-decomposability of complex ecological systems are essential to understanding and prediction because a hierarchical approach can greatly facilitate simplification and scaling. It is hardly justifiable theoretically and overwhelmingly difficult technically to translate information directly between two distant levels (or corresponding scales), when ignoring intervening levels that are relevant to the phenomenon under study. Although it may be possible to scale up from the cell to globe, or vice versa, successful approaches most likely have to be hierarchical. In this paper, 1 shall describe one such approach in which patch hierarchies are used as “scaling ladders”. This scaling ladder approach can help simplify the complexity of systems under study, enhance ecological understanding, and, at the same time, minimize the danger of intolerable error propagation in translating information across multiple scales.},

Change relates to recent complete harvesting and reestablishment, degradation or thinning is not considered. For the change maps two different strategies are proposed. The first one derives the changes by means of previously classified images of a multitemporal dataset and is thus referred to as “post-classification change detection”. For increasing the accuracy of the change maps a knowledge based change detection approach is introduced. The second strategy considers all scenes of the multitemporal dataset simultaneously. This method is referred to as “multidate classification”. Generally any kind of Earth Observation (EO) data allowing the grey value based separation of forest and non-forest can be applied with both strategies. In this study, JERS-1 (Japanese Earth Resource Satellite) SAR data are used for method development. The feasibility assessment of both object based mapping strategies is performed at five test sites: Germany (Thuringia), UK (Kielder), Sweden (Remningstorp and Brattåker) and Russia (Chunsky). Due to the specific data requirements (broad multitemporal dataset) the first approach could only be successfully implemented at the Thuringia site. It was also tested at Kielder, but with deficient results. The chapter concludes with the successful realisation of the approach at the Russian service case of GSE FM. Because of the given time frame (1990-recent) other EO data sources had to be implemented. As historical EO data source LANDSAT TM was selected, recent information is derived from ASAR APP.},

In this paper, we provide an updated estimate based on updated unit ecosystem service values and land use change estimates between 1997 and 2011. We also address some of the critiques of the 1997 paper. Using the same methods as in the 1997 paper but with updated data, the estimate for the total global ecosystem services in 2011 is \$125 trillion/yr (assuming updated unit values and changes to biome areas) and \$145 trillion/yr (assuming only unit values changed), both in 2007 \$US. From this we estimated the loss of eco-services from 1997 to 2011 due to land use change at \$4.3–20.2 trillion/yr, depending on which unit values are used. Global estimates expressed in monetary accounting units, such as this, are useful to highlight the magnitude of eco-services, but have no specific decision-making context. However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies. We emphasize that valuation of eco-services (in whatever units) is not the same as commodification or privatization. Many eco-services are best considered public goods or common pool resources, so conventional markets are often not the best institutional frameworks to manage them. However, these services must be (and are being) valued, and we need new, common asset institutions to better take these values into account.},

In this paper, we present several types of decision tree classification algorithms arid evaluate them on three different remote sensing data sets. The decision tree classification algorithms tested include an univariate decision tree, a multivariate decision tree, and a hybrid decision tree capable of including several different types of classification algorithms within a single decision tree structure. Classification accuracies produced by each of these decision tree algorithms are compared with both maximum likelihood and linear discriminant function classifiers. Results from this analysis show that the decision tree algorithms consistently outperform the maximum likelihood and linear discriminant function classifiers in regard to classf — cation accuracy. In particular, the hybrid tree consistently produced the highest classification accuracies for the data sets tested. More generally, the results from this work show that decision trees have several advantages for remote sensing applications by virtue of their relatively simple, explicit, and intuitive classification structure. Further, decision tree algorithms are strictly nonparametric and, therefore, make no assumptions regarding the distribution of input data, and are flexible and robust with respect to nonlinear and noisy relations among input features and class labels.},

	abstract = {Choice of a classification algorithm is generally based upon a number of factors, among which are availability of software, ease of use, and performance, measured here by overall classification accuracy. The maximum likelihood (ML) procedure is, for many users, the algorithm of choice because of its ready availability and the fact that it does not require an extended training process. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are now widely used by researchers, but their operational applications are hindered by the need for the user to specify the configuration of the network architecture and to provide values for a number of parameters, both of which affect performance. The ANN also requires an extended training phase.

In the past few years, the use of decision trees (DTs) to classify remotely sensed data has increased. Proponents of the method claim that it has a number of advantages over the ML and ANN algorithms. The DT is computationally fast, make no statistical assumptions, and can handle data that are represented on different measurement scales. Software to implement DTs is readily available over the Internet. Pruning of DTs can make them smaller and more easily interpretable, while the use of boosting techniques can improve performance.

In this study, separate test and training data sets from two different geographical areas and two different sensors—multispectral Landsat ETM+ and hyperspectral DAIS—are used to evaluate the performance of univariate and multivariate DTs for land cover classification. Factors considered are: the effects of variations in training data set size and of the dimensionality of the feature space, together with the impact of boosting, attribute selection measures, and pruning. The level of classification accuracy achieved by the DT is compared to results from back-propagating ANN and the ML classifiers. Our results indicate that the performance of the univariate DT is acceptably good in comparison with that of other classifiers, except with high-dimensional data. Classification accuracy increases linearly with training data set size to a limit of 300 pixels per class in this case. Multivariate DTs do not appear to perform better than univariate DTs. While boosting produces an increase in classification accuracy of between 3\% and 6\%, the use of attribute selection methods does not appear to be justified in terms of accuracy increases. However, neither the univariate DT nor the multivariate DT performed as well as the ANN or ML classifiers with high-dimensional data.},

The spatial resolution for the land cover classification is 8 km, intermediate between our previously published coarse one degree by one degree spatial resolution and the 1 km global land cover product being developed under the auspices of the International Geosphere Biosphere Program. We first derive a global network of training sites from Landsat imagery, using 156 Landsat scenes mostly from the Multispectral Scanner System, to identify over 9000 pixels in the PAL data where we have high confidence that the labelled cover type occurs. We then use the training data to test a number of metrics that describe the temporal dynamics of vegetation over an annual cycle for potential use as input variables to a global land cover classification. The tested metrics are based on: (i) the ratio between surface temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); (ii) seasonal metrics derived from the NDVI temporal profile, such as length of growing season; (iii) a rule-based approach that determines cover type through a series of hierarchical trees based on surface temperature and NDVI values; and (iv) annual mean, maximum, minimum and amplitude values for all optical and thermal channels in the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (PAL) data. Highest mean class accuracies from a decision tree classifier were obtained using the annual mean, maximum, minimum, and amplitude values for all AVHRR bands. Finally, we apply these metrics to 1984 PAL data at 8 km resolution to derive a global land cover classification product using a decision tree classifier. The classification has an overall accuracy between 81.4 and 90.3\%. The Landsat images used for deriving the training data and the methodology for classification of AVHRR data at 8km resolution can also be applied to 1 km AVHRR data and, in the future, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at 250 and 500m resolution.

	abstract = {Abstract.  Monitoring of regional vegetation and surface biophysical properties is tightly constrained by both the quantity and quality of ground data. Stratified sampling is often used to increase sampling efficiency, but its effectiveness hinges on appropriate classification of the land surface. A good classification must be sufficiently detailed to include the important sources of spatial variability, but at the same time it should be as parsimonious as possible to conserve scarce and expensive degrees of freedom in ground data. As part of the First ISLSCP (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Program) Field Experiment (FIFE), we used Regression Tree Analysis to derive an ecological classification of a tall grass prairie landscape. The classification is derived from digital terrain, land use, and land cover data and is based on their association with spectral vegetation indices calculated from single-date and multi-temporal satellite imagery. The regression tree analysis produced a site stratification that is similar to the a priori scheme actually used in FIFE, but is simpler and considerably more effective in reducing sample variance in surface measurements of variables such as biomass, soil moisture and Bowen Ratio. More generally, regression tree analysis is a useful technique for identifying and estimating complex hierarchical relationships in multivariate data sets.},

This study presents and analyses results from the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA 2015) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \{FRA\} 2015 was based on responses to surveys by individual countries using a common reporting framework, agreed definitions and reporting standards. Results indicated that total forest area declined by 3\%, from 4128 M ha in 1990 to 3999 M ha in 2015. The annual rate of net forest loss halved from 7.3 M ha y−1 in the 1990s to 3.3 M ha y−1 between 2010 and 2015. Natural forest area declined from 3961 M ha to 3721 M ha between 1990 and 2015, while planted forest (including rubber plantations) increased from 168 M ha to 278 M ha. From 2010 to 2015, tropical forest area declined at a rate of 5.5 M ha y−1 – only 58\% of the rate in the 1990s – while temperate forest area expanded at a rate of 2.2 M ha y−1. Boreal and sub-tropical forest areas showed little net change. Forest area expanded in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, East Asia, and Western-Central Asia, but declined in Central America, South America, South and Southeast Asia and all three regions in Africa. Analysis indicates that, between 1990 and 2015, 13 tropical countries may have either passed through their forest transitions from net forest loss to net forest expansion, or continued along the path of forest expansion that follows these transitions. Comparing \{FRA\} 2015 statistics with the findings of global and pan-tropical remote-sensing forest area surveys was challenging, due to differences in assessment periods, the definitions of forest and remote sensing methods. More investment in national and global forest monitoring is needed to provide better support for international initiatives to increase sustainable forest management and reduce forest loss, particularly in tropical countries.},

	abstract = {Abstract Sustainable forest management (SFM) is many things to many people – yet a common thread is the production of forest goods and services for the present and future generations. The promise of sustainability is rooted in the two premises; first that ecosystems have the potential to renew themselves and second that economic activities and social perceptions or values that define human interaction with the environment are choices that can be modified to ensure the long term productivity and health of the ecosystem. \{SFM\} addresses a great challenge in matching the increasing demands of a growing human population while maintaining ecological functions of healthy forest ecosystems. This paper does not seek to define SFM, but rather provides analyses of key indicators for the national-scale enabling environment to gain a global insight into progress in implementing enabling and implementing \{SFM\} at the national and operational levels. Analyses of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA) country report data are used to provide insights into the current state of progress in implementing the enabling conditions for SFM. Over 2.17 billion ha of the world’s forest area are predicted by governments to remain in permanent forest land use, of which some 1.1 billion ha are covered by all of the \{SFM\} tools investigated in \{FRA\} 2015. At the global scale, SFM-related policies and regulations are reported to be in place on 97\% of global forest area. While the number of countries with national forest inventories has increased over that past ten years from 48 to 112, only 37\% of forests in low income countries are covered by forest inventories. Forest management planning and monitoring of plans has increased substantially as has forest management certification, which exceeded a total of over 430 million ha in 2014. However, 90\% of internationally verified certification is in the boreal and temperate climatic domains – only 6\% of permanent forests in the tropical domain have been certified as of 2014. Results show that more work is needed to expand the extent and depth of work on establishing the enabling conditions that support \{SFM\} over the long term and suggests where those needs are greatest.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper focuses on an analysis of planted forests data from the 2015 Forests Resources Assessment of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FRA 2015). It forms one of a series of papers in the \{FRA\} 2015 special issue of this journal. While total forest area decreased from 4.28 billion hectares to 3.99 billion hectares from 1990 to 2015, with percent global forest cover dropping from 31.85\% to 30.85\%, the area of planted forests increased from 167.5 to 277.9 million hectares or 4.06\% to 6.95\% of total forest area. Increase was most rapid in the temperate zone, and regionally in East Asia, followed by Europe, North America, and Southern and Southeast Asia. However the annualised rate of increase in area of planted forests slowed in the 2010–2015 period to 1.2\%, below the 2.4\% rate suggested is needed to supply all of the world’s timber and fibre needs. The majority of planted forests comprised native species with only 18–19\% of the total area being of introduced species. Introduced species were dominant in the southern hemisphere countries of South America, Oceania and Eastern and Southern Africa where industrial forestry is dominant. Twenty countries accounted for 85\% of planted forest area and a different 20 countries for 87\% of planted forest roundwood supply. As with forest area, roundwood supply from planted forests also showed an increasing trend although this was based on minimal data. There was a mismatch in composition and rankings of the top 20 countries with top forest area and roundwood production suggesting that there are substantial opportunities to increase roundwood production in the future, especially in China which has the largest area but is currently ranked 3rd in roundwood production. Outlook statements were developed for the \{FAO\} sub regions based on past changes in planted forest area, population growth, and climate and forest health risks to identify key issues for the future. The overall view from this study suggests that climate impacts, especially from extreme climatic events will affect planted forests in the future and that forest health impacts can also be expected to increase. Outlooks vary regionally. Europe and North America are likely to be most concerned with climate and health risks; Asia will experience population pressure that will impact on land availability for new forests and risks from extreme weather events, and will need to make the most of its existing forests; Africa will need to increase planted forest area to offset continuing deforestation and rapid population growth; and Oceania, the Caribbean, Central and South America are likely to be most concerned with climate impacts. To ensure the continued contribution of planted forests, a number of responses will be required to both maintain existing and also to develop new forests. Intensification of production in existing forests will lessen the need for greater forest areas and offset any land use conflicts related to food security; climate adaptation strategies will need to be developed as a matter of urgency, and forest health focus must remain a priority for research. Establishment of new forests will be eased through greater community and stakeholder engagement. Application of models such as WWF’s New Generation Plantations, which recognises the importance of society and the need to consider the full range of forest products and services within the wider landscape and spectrum of land uses, will be important. We recommend that to enable deeper analysis related to planted forests future \{FRA\} Assessments consider ways to better gather data specific to planted forests such as productivity so that this important component of global forests can be better understood.},

	abstract = {Abstract The global community has recognized the importance of forests for biodiversity, and has prioritized the preservation of forest biodiversity and ecosystem functions through multiple multilateral agreements and processes such as the Convention on Biodiversity’s Aichi Targets and the Millennium Development Goals. The Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) provides one mechanism for tracking progress toward such goals in three particular areas: primary forest area, protected forest areas, and areas designated for the conservation of biodiversity. In this paper, we quantify current area and trends in forest areas designated for the conservation of biodiversity, protected forest areas, and primary forests by country and biome; and examine the association between total forest area and measures of protection, per-capita income, and population. The overall findings suggest that countries are increasingly protecting forests of ecological significance at the global scale (7.7\% of forests were protected in 1990 rising to 16.3\% in 2015), with a strong upward trend in protected areas in the tropical domain (from 12\% in 1990 to 26.3\% in 2015). However, primary forest area has declined by 2.5\% globally and by 10\% in the tropics over the period 1990–2015 (using data for countries that reported in all years). Given that many species in the tropics are endemic to primary forests, losses in that climatic domain continue to be of concern, although the rate of decline appears to be slowing. Using multiple regression analysis, we find that a 1\% increase in protected area or area designated for biodiversity conservation within a country is associated with an increase in total forest area in that country of about 0.03\% (p \&lt; 0.05). A 1\% within-country increase in population density and per capita \{GDP\} are associated with a decrease in forest area of about 0.2\% (p \&lt; 0.01) and an increase in forest area of about 0.08\% (p \&lt; 0.05) respectively. Our findings also indicate that, since \{FRA\} is used as one mechanism for tracking progress toward goals like the \{AICHI\} Biodiversity Targets, country correspondents may require additional assistance toward reporting on primary forest, protected forest, and biodiversity conservation statistics.},

These transition countries are characterised by reforms to forest management and improvements in agricultural practices but also by significant expansions of planted forest, which account for ∼25–100\% of gains. Forest-area estimates of the \{FRA\} align with satellite-derived estimates, with deviations of ⩽±7\% globally and ⩽±17\% for the tropics. Mosaics comprised of trees outside forests, remnant forest patches, and young regenerating forests constitute a modest proportion of the tropical forest estate and are seemingly well inventoried by the FRA. Extensive areas of forest experienced partial canopy cover reduction since 2000, particularly in the tropics where their area is ∼6.5 times that deforested since 1990. The likelihood of the eventual loss of these forests and a decline in their capacity to provide goods and services is a matter of concern. Demand for industrial wood and fuelwood increased 35\% in the tropics since 1990, principally in poorer countries, and growth in demand will accelerate into the future, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Notwithstanding significant increases in forests within protected areas since 1990 to 517 Mha (16.3\%) globally and 379 Mha (26.6\%) in the tropics, increasing demands for ecological services, forest products, and climate change mitigation is likely to be met from an expanding area of planted forests more than from the declining area of natural forests, particularly in Africa. The global rate of planted-forest expansion since 1990 is close to a target rate of 2.4\% per annum necessary to replace wood supplied from natural forests in the medium term, though the expansion rate has declined to 1.5\% since 2005. Multiple-use forests permitting both production and conservation account for 26\% of the global forest area and 17\% of the tropical forest area, and have increased by 81.8 Mha or 8.5\% globally since 1990, with most gains in the tropics. Sustainable forest management in low-income and tropical countries remains modest, with only 37\% low-income country forests covered by forest inventories. International support has proven effective at increasing this coverage since 2010.},

	abstract = {Estimating accurate aboveground forest carbon stocks (AFCS) is always challenging in tropical regions due to the complex mosaic of forest structure and species diversity. This study evaluates the potential of high-resolution ALOS/PALSAR mosaics data in the tropical forests of central Sumatra to improve AFCS estimates. The study region has an average AFCS (47\% of the aboveground biomass) of 66 Mg C ha− 1 with a range of 1 to 334 Mg C ha− 1 and consists of natural forests including peat swamp, dry moist, regrowth, and mangrove, and plantation forests including rubber, acacia, oil palm, and coconut. Field measurements of AFCS were carried out in 87 (ha− 1) plots, where half of them were from plantation forests. Various possibilities including direct gamma naught backscatters and their ratios and various types of textures of dual polarized mosaics from the years 2009 and 2010 were examined applying regression modeling in a five step framework. R2, variable inflation factor (VIF), p-value, and root mean square errors (RMSE) were the major indicators considered for selection of best model in the calibration process. The potential models selected were cross validated by the leave-one-out (LOO) method where R2, RMSE, mean deviation (MD), and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE, model performance indicator) were examined. The results indicate that a simple combination of backscatters and their ratios provides an AFCS estimate with a RMSE of 45 Mg C ha− 1, more efficient than the average of field measured AFCS (NSE of 0.54), and R2 of 0.63. Inclusion of appropriate texture parameters derived from the high-resolution PALSAR mosaics further increases the potential for AFCS estimation by increasing R2 and model performance (NSE) to 0.84 and 0.83, respectively and decreasing the uncertainty to 28 Mg C ha− 1. This SAR based method offers the low cost wall-to-wall forest carbon mapping with a high level of accuracy in the dense tropical forest regions of Southeast Asia where other methods are still rare.},

	abstract = {As remote sensing data and methods have become increasingly complex and varied - and increasingly reliable - so have their uses in forest management. New algorithms have been developed in virtually every aspect of image analysis, from classification to enhancements to estimating parameters. Remote Sensing for Sustainable Forest Management reviews the literature and provides the tools for understanding and choosing remote sensing solutions for management problems. The book presents methods and operational examples of forest change detection, forest defoliation monitoring, forest classification, and forest growth modeling. The concluding chapters discuss research issues and the future of remote sensing technologies. The author draws a comprehensive picture of the state of the art in remote sensing data and methods applicable to sustainable forest management issues. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, the author addresses the 'I tried that once, didn't work, so the whole thing is useless' syndrome that has created institutional inertia in some management agencies. We now know the proper processing steps, the most efficient algorithms, what kinds of maps can be generated, and by whom, and what level of confidence managers can invest in the resulting products. We know under what conditions aerial remote sensing missions should be executed, what are the limits, and where investments in equipment and training should be made. This authoritative book explores the remote sensing methods that need to be adopted and adapted to the forest science issues that are emerging through the sustainable forest management approach. This approach is not driven by technology, but by questions about its fundamental processes. Remote Sensing for Sustainable Forest Management shows you how this technology can be used to answer these questions and achieve the goals of sustainable forest management.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity conservation and ecosystem-service provision will increasingly depend on the existence of secondary vegetation. Our success in achieving these goals will be determined by our ability to accurately estimate the structure and diversity of such communities at broad geographic scales. We examined whether the texture (the spatial variation of the image elements) of very high-resolution satellite imagery can be used for this purpose. In 14 fallows of different ages and one mature forest stand in a seasonally dry tropical forest landscape, we estimated basal area, canopy cover, stem density, species richness, Shannon index, Simpson index, and canopy height. The first six attributes were also estimated for a subset comprising the tallest plants. We calculated 40 texture variables based on the red and the near infrared bands, and EVI and NDVI, and selected the best-fit linear models describing each vegetation attribute based on them. Basal area (R2 = 0.93), vegetation height and cover (0.89), species richness (0.87), and stand age (0.85) were the best-described attributes by two-variable models. Cross validation showed that these models had a high predictive power, and most estimated vegetation attributes were highly accurate. The success of this simple method (a single image was used and the models were linear and included very few variables) rests on the principle that image texture reflects the internal heterogeneity of successional vegetation at the proper scale. The vegetation attributes best predicted by texture are relevant in the face of two of the gravest threats to biosphere integrity: climate change and biodiversity loss. By providing reliable basal area and fallow-age estimates, image-texture analysis allows for the assessment of carbon sequestration and diversity loss rates. New and exciting research avenues open by simplifying the analysis of the extent and complexity of successional vegetation through the spatial variation of its spectral information.},

A first test of this logic for the continental United States is presented based on an existing 1 km AVHRR normalized difference vegetation index database. Procedures for solving critical remote sensing problems needed to implement the classification are discussed. Also, some inferences from this classification to advanced vegetation biophysical variables such as specific leaf area and photosynthetic capacity useful to global biogeochemical modeling are suggested.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to develop a new methodology for monitoring forest disturbances and regrowth using ALOS PALSAR data in tropical regions. In the study, forest disturbances and regrowth were assessed between 2007 and 2010 in Vietnam, Cambodia and Lao People’s Democratic Republic. The deforestation rate in Vietnam has been among the highest in the tropics in the last few decades, and those in Cambodia and Lao are increasing rapidly. L-band ALOS PALSAR mosaic data were used for the detection of forest disturbances and regrowth, because L-band SAR intensities are sensitive to forest aboveground biomass loss. The methodology used here combines SAR data processing, which is particularly suited for change detection, forest detection and forest disturbances and regrowth detection using expectation maximization, which is closely related to fuzzy logic. A reliable training and testing database has been derived using AVNIR-2 and Google Earth images for calibration and validation. Efforts were made to apply masking areas that are likely to show different SAR backscatter temporal behaviors from the forests considered in the study, including mangroves, inundated forests, post-flooding or irrigated croplands and water bodies, as well as sloping areas and urban areas. The resulting forest disturbances and regrowth map (25-m resolution) indicates disturbance rates of −1.07\% in Vietnam, −1.22\% in Cambodia and −0.94\% in Lao between 2007 and 2010, with corresponding aboveground biomass losses of 60.7  Tg, 59.2  Tg and 83.8                                        Tg , respectively.

Forest cover is interpreted from satellite imagery at 30 × 30 m resolution. Forest cover changes are then combined with pan-tropical biomass maps to estimate carbon losses. We show that there was a gross loss of tropical forests of 8.0 million ha yr−1 in the 1990s and 7.6 million ha yr−1 in the 2000s (0.49\% annual rate), with no statistically significant difference. Humid forests account for 64\% of the total forest cover in 2010 and 54\% of the net forest loss during second study decade. Losses of forest cover and Other Wooded Land (OWL) cover result in estimates of carbon losses which are similar for 1990s and 2000s at 887 MtC yr−1 (range: 646–1238) and 880 MtC yr−1 (range: 602–1237) respectively, with humid regions contributing two-thirds. The estimates of forest area changes have small statistical standard errors due to large sample size. We also reduce uncertainties of previous estimates of carbon losses and removals. Our estimates of forest area change are significantly lower as compared to national survey data. We reconcile recent low estimates of carbon emissions from tropical deforestation for early 2000s and show that carbon loss rates did not change between the two last decades. Carbon losses from deforestation represent circa 10\% of Carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production during the last decade (2000–2010). Our estimates of annual removals of carbon from forest regrowth at 115 MtC yr−1 (range: 61–168) and 97 MtC yr−1 (53–141) for the 1990s and 2000s respectively are five to fifteen times lower than earlier published estimates.},

Whether these new agricultural lands replace forests, degraded forests, or grasslands greatly influences the environmental consequences of expansion. Although the general pattern is known, there still is no definitive quantification of these land-cover changes. Here we analyze the rich, pan-tropical database of classified Landsat scenes created by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations to examine pathways of agricultural expansion across the major tropical forest regions in the 1980s and 1990s and use this information to highlight the future land conversions that probably will be needed to meet mounting demand for agricultural products. Across the tropics, we find that between 1980 and 2000 more than 55\% of new agricultural land came at the expense of intact forests, and another 28\% came from disturbed forests. This study underscores the potential consequences of unabated agricultural expansion for forest conservation and carbon emissions.},

	abstract = {The importance of understanding the causes of tropical deforestation hardly needs emphasizing as the 1990s begin. However, a major difficulty researchers in all fields face is that time paths of forest cover change in tropical areas are poorly understood. Despite path-breaking volumes by John Richards and Richard Tucker, the history of the decline of tropical forests is still largely unknown. This article looks as closely as the data permits at the history of forest cover in the Philippines. It will briefly review data sources and forest types, and discuss the pre- and post-1950 history of forest cover. The history of forest decline in the post-1950 period will then provide the basis for the calculation of deforestation rates from 1950 to 1987. The quantity, quality, and comparability of available forest cover data are usually less than what social scientists would desire. Since this situation is unlikely to change for the better in the near future, the best a researcher can do is to use creativity (carefully) in gathering data from a variety of sources, state as clearly as possible the strengths and weak- nesses of each data set, and on the basis of the first two steps, present a well-reasoned argument that captures the major elements of the process under discussion. The researcher encounters severe problems with data when attempting to reconstruct the decline of twentieth-century Philippine forest cover. However, there is enough information to analyze a general outline of Philippine forest cover decline.},

Adaptations of trees to climate and resource gradients, coupled with disturbances and forest dynamics, create complex geographical patterns in forest assemblages and structures. These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and airborne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosystem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest distribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite increasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also apparently become more dynamic. Advanced information about the structure, distribution, and biomass of the world's forests provides critical ecological insights and opportunities for sustainable forest management and enhancing forest conservation and ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Forest ecosystems are being degraded and lost because of rapid population change and economic incentives that make forest conversion appear more profitable than forest conservation. All ecological functions of forests are also economic functions. Many important forest functions have no markets, and hence, no apparent economic value, justifying the use of forest land for other purposes. Imputing economic values to nonmarketed benefits has the potential to change radically the way we look at all forests and to make the pendulum swing back from a presumption in favor of forest conversion to more conservation and sustainable use. This paper surveys what we know about forest economic values and draws policy conclusions from the now substantial literature that values nonmarket benefits of forests. Estimating economic values is not enough. The subsequent stage of policy is to design markets that capture the values—‘market creation’—ideally for the benefit of the many vulnerable communities that rely on the forests for their well-being. These conclusions support the wider argument for using effective economic instruments to promote conservation of the remaining forests. Forest loss involves: risks to human health; accelerated climate change; increased watershed disruption, adding to eutrophication in inland and coastal waters; loss of water quality; and loss of biodiversity.},

	url = {http://www.intechopen.com/books/forest-ecosystems-more-than-just-trees},
	abstract = {The common idea for many people is that forests are just a collection of trees. However, they are much more than that. They are a complex, functional system of interacting and often interdependent biological, physical, and chemical components, the biological part of which has evolved to perpetuate itself. This complexity produces combinations of climate, soils, trees and plant species unique to each site, resulting in hundreds of different forest types around the world. Logically, trees are an important component for the research in forest ecosystems, but the wide variety of other life forms and abiotic components in most forests means that other elements, such as wildlife or soil nutrients, should also be the focal point in ecological studies and management plans to be carried out in forest ecosystems. In this book, the readers can find the latest research related to forest ecosystems but with a different twist. The research described here is not just on trees and is focused on the other components, structures and functions that are usually overshadowed by the focus on trees, but are equally important to maintain the diversity, function and services provided by forests. The first section of this book explores the structure and biodiversity of forest ecosystems, whereas the second section reviews the research done on ecosystem structure and functioning. The third and last section explores the issues related to forest management as an ecosystem-level activity, all of them from the perspective of the "other" parts of a forest.},

According to FAO, as of 2000, the world had 3.9 billion hectares (ha) of forests with 187 million ha (5\%) in forest plantations. Drawing on additional surveys and our research, we estimate that there were approximately 204 million ha of planted forests as of 2002. Public ownership comprised 87\% of the world's total forest area, with the US having the largest share of privately owned forests and almost all forests in Africa being publicly owned. Approximately 1.7 billion ha of forests (43\%) were reported to be covered by forest management plans, and 477 million ha (12\%) were under formal forest protection decrees or laws. However, the degree of management intensity and forest protection actually realized by these reported data is moot. Forest certification includes 121 million ha (3\%) of forests, with 93\% of the certification occurring in the Northern Hemisphere, but most of the deforestation occurring in the Southern Hemisphere. The data provide evidence that many countries in the world are trying to achieve sustainable forest management, and certainly are trying to report data that suggest that they are moving toward sustainable forest management goals. The empirical evidence that forests are actually well managed and protected, however, is often lacking. Enhanced sustainable forest management will require better reporting and verification, more areas covered and enhanced implementation of sustainable forest management criteria and indicators in the future.},

The following land cover types were investigated: bare soil, agriculture, pastures, forest regrowth from 1 to 23-year-old and primary forest. Backscatter behaviour of regrowth stands is influenced by the previous land use and by human impacts such as fire and selective logging. This selective logging can be mechanized or not, because people who live in the Amazon usually cut trees to build houses, bridges, fences, etc. Backscatter of young regrowth stands on sites immediately abandoned after slash and burn increases at a faster rate than young regrowth on sites abandoned after some years of agriculture. Backscatter of old regrowth stands also behaves differently where there are disturbances such as fire or selective logging. In the presence of such disturbances, one finds an oscillating pattern over time, while undisturbed forest shows either a progressive trend or a stable pattern, depending on the age of the stand.},

	abstract = {Every day forests provide benefits vital to life on Earth and to the quality of human life
in particular. Currently, some 410 million people are highly dependent on them for subsistence and income, and 1.6 billion people depend on forest goods and services for some part of their livelihoods.1 In a more general sense, the entire global population depends on forests for their carbon-sequestering services. Forests have always been crucial to human life and economies, and they will become increasingly significant as the global human population grows by another 30 per cent – to 9 billion people – by mid-century. At the same time, our forests face many threats as a result of unsustainable use. As we move forward, our forests must play a critical role in supporting the growth of a global green economy.2 Innovative solutions, however, must be found to ensure sustainable forest management in the face of the many threats at hand.
This policy brief seeks to outline how forests can be a key part of a green economy that provides opportunities for innovative solutions to forest management. Forests are key assets in the structuring of a green economy as they provide a wide variety of services, including ecological infrastructure, which comprises public goods such as water and carbon regulation and tradeable goods such as timber, fibre, biomass and non-timber forest products. They also act as a source of livelihood, natural insurance, adaptation, employment and health services. Focusing on forests helps draw attention to the importance of creating a green economy at the local, regional and global levels.
The emergence of a green economy provides an opportunity for the development of innovative market and policy solutions that assign appropriate value to forests for the wide variety of benefits that they provide to people while also promoting long-term sustainable forest management. Innovative policies that create markets and present forests as investment-worthy assets within the economic system will attract new investment in forest management and conservation from both the public and private sectors.

In this brief we first provide an overview of the many values of forest assets before reviewing the complex issues that threaten forests globally and lastly looking at the emerging innovative market and policy solutions that can promote long-term sustainable forest management and contribute to a green economy.},

	abstract = {Mapping anthropogenic forest disturbances has largely been focused on distinct delineations of events of deforestation using optical satellite images. In the tropics, frequent cloud cover and the challenge of quantifying forest degradation remain problematic. In this study, we detect processes of deforestation, forest degradation and successional dynamics, using long-wavelength radar (L-band from ALOS PALSAR) backscatter. We present a detection algorithm that allows for repeated disturbances on the same land, and identifies areas with slow- and fast-recovering changes in backscatter in close spatial and temporal proximity. In the study area in Madre de Dios, Peru, 2.3\% of land was found to be disturbed over three years, with a false positive rate of 0.3\% of area. A low, but significant, detection rate of degradation from sparse and small-scale selective logging was achieved. Disturbances were most common along the tri-national Interoceanic Highway, as well as in mining areas and areas under no land use allocation. A continuous spatial gradient of disturbance was observed, highlighting artefacts arising from imposing discrete boundaries on deforestation events. The magnitude of initial radar backscatter, and backscatter decrease, suggested that large-scale deforestation was likely in areas with initially low biomass, either naturally or since already under anthropogenic use. Further, backscatter increases following disturbance suggested that radar can be used to characterize successional disturbance dynamics, such as biomass accumulation in lands post-abandonment. The presented radar-based detection algorithm is spatially and temporally scalable, and can support monitoring degradation and deforestation in tropical rainforests with the use of products from ALOS-2 and the future SAOCOM and BIOMASS missions.},

Especially random forests, which can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine, and bioinformatics within the past few years. High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application.

The basin covers most climatic zones: from high-altitude, snow-covered mountainous regions in the north, to subtropical and tropical rainforest areas and agricultural land further south. The geopolitically important region not only is home to over 72,000,000 inhabitants, but also is a centre of attention of several environmental modelling experts, trying to assess future hydrologic dynamics, climate variability, as well probable land-use developments in the area.We compare land-cover products of the University of Maryland, UMD 1992–1993, the GLC 2000 product, the GlobCover products of 2004–2006 and 2009, as well as the MODIS-derived land-cover products of 2001 and 2009. For harmonization of individual legends, the Land Cover Classification System, LCCS, has been employed. However, even after harmonization, cross-tabulation among the products reveals extreme differences, where the impact of differing classification algorithms weighs higher than the impact of temporal coincidence of products. Especially, differences within mixed-vegetation classes are large, strongly impacting the overall assessment of forested land, other vegetated land, and even cultivated land in the Mekong Basin. The findings presented here are of high relevance for the modelling community as well as Mekong-related environmental studies, which should consider global remote-sensing-derived products with caution and solid background knowledge.},

	abstract = {Land cover is a fundamental variable that impacts and links with many parts of the human and physical environments. However, mapping land cover particularly in the tropical regions is problematic due to persistent cloud cover, large and inaccessible areas, political instability, poor access to mapping data and weak government support to mapping agencies and research institutions. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of the dual-polarised TerraSAR-X (TSX) and quad-polarised L-band ALOS PALSAR satellite data for land cover mapping in the complex terrain of the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP). Polarimetric analysis of the satellite images was carried out using the Wishart maximum likelihood classification (WMLC) algorithm. A total of nine land cover classes were selected for analysis. For each land cover class, representative samples were extracted and used for land cover classification and accuracy assessment based on the interpretation of the high-resolution IKONOS satellite images as well as the a priori knowledge of the study area. Overall land cover classification accuracies of 86\% and 43.9\% were obtained using ALOS PALSAR and TSX data, respectively. These results indicate a realistic potential of using ALOS PALSAR data for land cover mapping compared with TSX data.},

There is a growing need for compatibility between datasets to map, evaluate, and monitor areas in a consistent manner. The FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) Land Cover Classification system (LCCS) is a proposed method to enable interoperability for land-cover data and an attempt to open the classification black box for scrutiny. The FAO LCCS is used to demonstrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of feature-based classification methods and how some important improvements, based on theoretical developments in geographic information science, can extend LCCS to become a ‘boundary object’ that supports representation, negotiation, and analysis of dynamic and heterogeneous classification systems. The suggested improvements also include an outline of how future classification activities could be developed into a distributed web-based ontology infrastructure.},

	abstract = {During the Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) project, the JERS-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite acquired wall-to-wall image coverage of the humid tropical forests of the world. The rationale for the project was to demonstrate the application of spaceborne L-band radar in tropical forest studies. In particular, the use of orbital radar data for mapping land cover types, estimating the area of floodplains, and monitoring deforestation and forest regeneration were of primary importance. In this paper we examine the information content of the JERS-1 SAR data for mapping land cover types in the Amazon basin. More than 1500 high-resolution (12.5 m pixel spacing) images acquired during the low flood period of the Amazon river were resampled to 100 m resolution and mosaicked into a seamless image of about 8 million km2, including the entire Amazon basin. This image was used in a classifier to generate a 1 km resolution land cover map. The inputs to the classifier were 1 km resolution mean backscatter and seven first-order texture measures derived from the 100 m data by using a 10 x 10 independent sampling window. The classification approach included two interdependent stages. First, a supervised maximum a posteriori Baysian approach classified the mean backscatter image into five general cover categories: terra firme forest (including secondary forest), savanna, inundated vegetation, open deforested areas and open water. A hierarchical decision rule based on texture measures was then applied to attempt further discrimination of known subcategories of vegetation types based on taxonomic information and woody biomass levels. True distributions of the general categories were identified from the RADAMBRASIL project vegetation maps and several field studies. Training and validation test sites were chosen from the JERS-1 image by consulting the RADAM vegetation maps. After several iterations and combining land cover types, 14 vegetation classes were successfully separated at the 1 km scale. The accuracy of the classification methodology was estimated to be 78\% when using the validation sites. The results were also verified by comparison with the RADAM- and AVHRR-based 1 km resolution land cover maps.},

	abstract = {The potential of airborne radar systems as tools for collecting information in support of the assessment of tropical primary forests and derived cover types was examined. SAR systems operating with high spatial resolutions and different wavelengths (i.e., X-, C-, L- and P-band) acquired data in Guyana and Colombia. Three fundamentally different information sources from the radar return signal were considered in the study: its strength or backscatter, polarization and phase, and spatial variability or texture. Radiometric, polarimetric, and textural attributes were computed from predefined image regions selected to represent five types of primary forest, selectively logged forest, secondary forest, and a mixture of nonforest cover types. Texture was found to be the most important source of information in high resolution X- and C-band images. Textural attributes computed per region made modest to good bases for automated classifications of the land cover types studied. Primary forests and logged-over forests were found to display particularly distinctive textural patterns. Backscatter values computed per region from L- and P-band radar images also made modest to good classification bases. Backscatter measurements in either a single L- or P-band channel enabled accurate classification of nonforest cover types. Reliable identification of secondary forests and logged-over forests generally asked for measurements in a minimum of two C-, L-, and/or P-band radar channels. Similarly, reliable assessment of primary forest types required observations in a minimum of three C-, L-, and/or P-band radar channels.},

This Letter addresses the underlying spatial conceptualization of the pixel, which is the parallel of the grid cell in spatial analysis, and the regular grid in sampling. It is argued that integration of remote sensing and GIS can only possibly advance if we develop methods to address the conceptual short-comings of the pixel as a spatial entity, and stop pretending that it is a true geographical object. Three major strands of research which address this issue are highlighted, including mixture modelling, geostatistics and fuzzy classification.},

	abstract = {This article concerns the derivation and use of a measure of similarity between two hierarchical clusterings. The measure, Bk , is derived from the matching matrix, [mij ], formed by cutting the two hierarchical trees and counting the number of matching entries in the k clusters in each tree. The mean and variance of Bk are determined under the assumption that the margins of [mij ] are fixed. Thus, Bk represents a collection of measures for k = 2, …, n – 1. (k, Bk ) plots are found to be useful in portraying the similarity of two clusterings. Bk is compared to other measures of similarity proposed respectively by Baker (1974) and Rand (1971). The use of (k, Bk ) plots for studying clustering methods is explored by a series of Monte Carlo sampling experiments. An example of the use of (k, Bk ) on real data is given.},

Basically, the speckles are signal-dependent and, therefore, act like multiplicative noise. This paper develops a statistical technique to define a noise model, and then successfully applies a local statistics noise filtering algorithm to a set of actual SEASAT SAR images. The smoothed images permit observers to resolve fine detail with an enhanced edge effect. Several SEASAT SAR images are used for demonstration.},

	abstract = {Speckle, appearing in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images as granular noise, is due to the interference of waves reflected from many elementary scatterers. Speckle in SAR images complicates the image interpretation problem by reducing the effectiveness of image segmentation and classification. To alleviate deleterious effects of speckle, various ways have been devised to suppress it. This paper surveys several better‐known speckle filtering algorithms. The concept of each filtering algorithm and the interrelationship between algorithms are discussed in detail. A set of performance criteria is established and comparisons are made for the effectiveness of these filters in speckle reduction and edge, line, and point target contrast preservation using a simulated SAR image as well as airborne and spaceborne SAR images. In addition, computational efficiency and implementation complexity are compared. This critical evaluation of speckle suppression filters is mostly new and is presented as a survey paper for the first time. It is believed that the information provided is sufficient for an intelligent selection of speckle filters for various applications.},

Data corresponding to basal taxonomies were perturbed by adding error to the ranks of the inter-specimen pair proximities. The goodness of fit of the dendrograms obtained from the perturbed data and that corresponding to the basal taxonomies were measured by means of the Goodman-Kruskal gamma coefficient. Empirical sampling distributions of the gamma coefficients indicated that the single linkage grouping technique was more sensitive to the type of data errors employed than the complete linkage technique.},
